<h1>Shower Thoughts Bot</h1>
<p>This is a bot that automatically posts shower thoughts to Twitter. It does this by grabbing the top showerthought of the day from the r/Showerthoughts subreddit.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<li>Install Python (Python 3+ required)</li>
<li>Clone the repo</li>
<code>git clone https://github.com/dontna/twitter_shower_thoughts</code>
<li>Install the Selenium module</li>
<code>pip install selenium</code>
or
<code>python -m pip install selenium</code>
<li>You're good to go</li>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
In order for the script to work as intended, you will need to add the details of the Twitter account you wish to use in the file. Simply open the file with your favourite IDE or text editor,
and replace all of the <code>userfield.send_keys("username here")</code> and <code>passfield.send_keys("password here")</code> with your Twitter username and password. <p>Example
<code>userfield.send_keys("dontna")</code> <code>passfield.send_keys("verysecurepassword1")</code></p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
I will not be updating this repository as it was just a little test project I did for fun. If you would like to add/remove things, please feel free.
